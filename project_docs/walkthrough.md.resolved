# AutoSEO Engine - Final MVP Walkthrough

## 🚀 System Status
**ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL**

1.  **Crawler**: Can scan any website and discover URLs.
    *   *Test*: `node test-crawl.js`
2.  **Intelligence Brain (AI)**:
    *   **Linker**: Context-aware internal linking (Mock Mode active).
    *   **Rewriter**: Content optimizer (Mock Mode active).
3.  **Automation Loop**:
    *   Crawler triggers -> `PROCESS_ARTICLE` job -> AI Processor -> Database Save.

## 🛠️ How to Use (Developers)

### 1. Start Support Server
```bash
cd core
npm run start:dev
```

### 2. Trigger a Crawl
```bash
# In another terminal
node test-crawl.js
```
*Watch the logs to see the "Discovery -> Rewrite -> Publish" pipeline.*

### 3. Check Database
```bash
node verify-processed.js
```
*Verifies that articles have been rewritten and marked as 'PUBLISHED'.*

## 🔮 What's Next (Roadmap)
- [ ] **UI Dashboard**: Build a Next.js Admin Panel.
- [ ] **Production AI**: Add real `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- [ ] **Job Queue**: Switch from In-Memory to Redis for scale.
- [ ] **Deployment**: Dockerize for cloud (AWS/DigitalOcean).
